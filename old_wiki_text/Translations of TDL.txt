ToDoList finally supports translating its user interface using a single csv file
 
This means that you no longer have to be a programmer to translate the software.
 
All you have to do is:
 
1. Download this file
2. Unzip it
3. Rename it in the style 'Language (Country).csv'
4. Open it in Excel or Wordpad
5. Add your translation to the second column.
6. Send it back to me when it's complete and I'll add it to the download package 
 
Note: You must not alter the English text in the first column else this will break the translation system.
 
Note2: I've currently got translators for German, French, Italian, Spanish and Russian, but email me anyway because it would be good to have backup translators.
