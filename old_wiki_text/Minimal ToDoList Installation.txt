Minimal ToDoList Installation
* At time of writing, Nov. 2013, TDL 6.5.8 has been used for the purposes of this article.
(Also see Minimal ToDoList install?)

ToDoList is in inherently a 'portable app' - nothing need be installed, merely download and unzip the .zip file then double-click on the .exe.

There may be times when one wants to share a common 'app' folder, containing but one or a few list (.tdl) files, with as small a footprint as possible. Because the settings (.ini) file stores beside the program (.exe) itself, the folder can be shared (such as via Dropbox) and a team 'solution' quickly delivered. Each team member can then create their own shortcuts to these shared files, or simply directly double-click on them. If Dropbox is used, then Android installations are also instantly updated.

 At first double-click of a .tdl file the program to use is prompted for - select the accompanying .exe file and the data/program file association is saved.

If there are both viewing and authoring team members, an auto-save .html option can be enabled, and any list changes will automatically update the .html, and thus all team members - be they readers or writers.

If using Dropbox, links to the files can be given out to create readers, or the folder itself shared to create writers. Local Dropbox replica files (both .exe and .tdl) can then be used directly for full speed local access, or your local TDL install used with the Dropbox .tdl data files. Note, however, with the latter, any preference (.ini) changes will stay beside your local todolist.exe file, not the dropbox .exe file - if creating a team 'solution' you will want to double-click on the .exe in the Dropbox folder.
 
As lists are changed or created, or a new version of the program becomes available, any file changes can be copied into this shared folder, and all team members are instantly updated. Unless .tdl or .exe file names change, shortcuts will continue to work.
 
 
Minimal ToDoList Folder/File Layout:
- for ease of viewing / maintenance, assume a top level (shared) folder of 'OurSharedLists', and that all ToDoList / program related files are placed under a ToDoList sub-folder.

OurSharedLists/{files} - .tdl, .html, and like list / output files. Open the shared folder, double-click a file, and instantly be productive.

OurSharedLists/ToDoList/todolist.exe
- and you're done. The vast majority of TDL's functionality is present.

OurSharedLists/ToDoList/todolist.ini - automatically read / created at need beside the .exe. (Permits different 'apps' to have their own settings.
 
 
Additional functionality can be delivered by not deleting additional TDL program files:
- GUI / interface functionality appears when TDL finds the associated .dll files are present.

Backups: 
OutSharedLists/ToDoList/Backups (folder)
 - contains backup files, if auto-backup (relative) option turned on.

OutSharedLists/ToDoList/SpellCheck
- contains dictionary files, as per FAQ #4 and Spellcheck Dictionaries.
- copy downloaded dictionary files here, as needed.
- copy MySpellCheck.dll beside the .exe

- copy CalendarExt.dll beside the .exe

Rich Text Comments:

List Encryption:
- copy EncryptDecrypt.dll  beside the .exe
