AutoHotKey Command Reference
 
The full list of commands that AutoHotKey provides can be found at
http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands.htm.
 
 
Sample Scripts (code can be found here)
 
Name
Description
 
 
Paste Task above/before Selected Task
After a task has been cut out or copied ToDoList offers two options:
'Paste as Subtask of Selected Task' and 'Paste after Selected Task'.
This AHK script offers the third alternative: Paste Task above/before 
Selected Task. 
Replace email adresses like 
'user@email.com' automatically with 
'mailto:user@email.com' in the Comments 
field. 
By default the script code checks every second if ToDoList is active, 
and if it is active, searches the comment field for email addresses 
(like 'user@email.com') and replaces them with mailto: email 
addresses (e.g. mailto:user@email.com).
 
Scripts to address the views in ToDoList 
directly
ToDoList offers two options to change the view (respectively to put 
the focus on TaskTreeView, ListView or Comments): 
With {F10} and {F11} you can toggle between the views. 
With these 4 scripts you can address the views directly. 
The scripts are meant as an addition to the 2 options Toggle.
Set set the due date and clear the due date 
respectively
